LibreOffice is not installed.
If you are on Ubuntu/Debian run: sudo apt install libreoffice
For other Linux distros see https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download-libreoffice/ for installation instructions.
The program will continue to run but without the LibreOffice converter. (This may mean a loss of functionality)
