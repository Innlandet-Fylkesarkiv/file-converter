A module-based .NET application that converts files and generates documentation for archiving.

This application provides a framework for different conversion libraries/software to work together. It aims to promote a comprehensive open-source solution for file conversion, as opposed to the many paid options, which allows for multi-step conversion between different external libraries.

# üìñ Background
This project is part of a collaboration with **[Innlandet County Archive](https://www.visarkiv.no/)** and is a Bachelor's thesis project for a [Bachelor's in Programming](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/bprog) at the **[Norwegian University of Technology and Science (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.edu/)**.

In Norway, the act of archiving is regulated by the Archives Act, which states that public bodies have a duty to register and preserve documents that are created as part of their activity [^1]. As society is becoming more digitized so is information, and the documents that were previously physical and stored physically are now digital and stored digitally. Innlandet County Archive is an inter-municipal archive cooperation, that registers and preserves documents from 48 municipalities. However, not all file types they receive are suitable for archiving as they run a risk of becoming obsolete. (For further reading see: [Obsolescence: File Formats and Software](https://dpworkshop.org/dpm-eng/oldmedia/obsolescence1.html)) Innlandet County Archive wished to streamline its conversion process into one application that could deal with a vast array of file formats. Furthermore, archiving is based on the principles of accessibility, accountability and integrity, which is why this application also provides documentation of all changes made to files.

Much like programmers and software developers, archivists believe in an open source world. Therefore it would only be right for this program to be open source.

<br>

### Further download instructions for LibreOffice 
#### :window: Windows
Libreoffice must be manually added to ```PATH``` on Windows for the program to convert office files. The deafult installation path to Libreoffice is ```"C:\Program Files\LibreOffice"```, but the entry needs to be ```"C:\Program Files\LibreOffice\program"```.

1. Open *Settings* -> *Home* -> *About* (scroll down on the left) -> *Advanced system settings* (on the right) -> *Environment variables.*
> [!TIP]
> Alternatively use the ```Windows key + R``` on the keyboard, then type in ```"sysdm.cpl"``` and hit enter. Thereafter, press *Advanced* and then *Environment variables.*
2. Locate the ```PATH``` variable and highlight it. Press *Edit* -> *New* -> copy the path to the program folder -> press *Ok*. This adds it to the users environment variables.
   
<br><br>
**[wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html)** must also be manually added to ```PATH```. For windows, it can be done as described above, just swap ```"C:\Program Files\LibreOffice\program"``` with ```"C:\Program Files\wkhtmltopdf\bin"```. 

#### üêß Linux
For Linux the default installation directory is ```...``` <br>
To add it as an environment variable:
1. Open the file ```.bashrc``` using ```nano ~/.bashrc```.
2. Navigate to the bottom of the file with the arrow keys and add this line at the end ```export PATH="$PATH:DefaultPathHere"```. Remember to save the file and exit.
3.  To apply the changes immediately run the command ```source ~/.bashrc```. Alternatively, log in and out.
4.   To verify, run the command ```echo $PATH``` and the path added should be at the end of the output from the command.

## üî® Beta
Since the program is still in beta, there are some **limitations** or **bugs** in the software. This section will be updated throughout the development process as we fix or find problems.
The program is mostly tested in Windows, so Linux specific issues may not appear in list. 
- (Landscape oriented PDF or PDF/A -> PDF/A or other PDF version)
  	- There is a bug where iText7 doesn't recognize that a document is landscape oriented when converting from PDF->PDF/A. This results in the content of the file being cropped to portrait.
  	- UPDATE: May be resolved, more testing required.
- Parsing siegfried data from incomplete run
  	- The current version of the program cannot successfully recover siegfried data from an incomplete run
  	  
- (Compressed files)
  	- Zip is the only tested format, but .tar .gz .7z and .rar is also supported in the current version. It seems stable, but it is best to double check results.
- HTML -> PDF
  	- This conversion does not work, even though the program may think it did based on the output file's pronom. Output file will be empty.
- GUI
  	- Starting GUI from main program will crash the program on Linux
- Office conversion (Linux)
  	- Office conversion using LibreOffice does not work correctly
  
## CLI
Cover options and common usage
```
$ cd C:\PathToFolder\bin\Debug\net8.0
$ .\file-converter-prog2900.exe 
```

## Arguments
> [!NOTE]
> All paths must be *absolute* or *relative* to executable.

### Set custom input folder 
Default: *input*
```
$ .\example -i "C:\Users\user\Downloads
$ .\example --input "C:\Users\user\Downloads
```

### Set custom output folder
Default: *output*
```
$ .\example -o "C:\Users\user\Downloads
$ .\example --output "C:\Users\user\Downloads
```

### Set custom settings file 
<br>Default: *Settings.xml*
```
$ .\example -s "C:\Users\user\custom_settings.xml"
$ .\example --settings "C:\Users\user\custom_settings.xml"
```

$ .\example --yes 
```

## GUI
![gui](https://github.com/larsmhaugland/file-converter/assets/117298604/0fd96cea-d84c-4b83-91b6-737c74ba8baf)
<div align="center">
	<i>GUI-version of Settings</i>
	<br>
</div>

The GUI provides a more user-friendly way of editing the settings of the application (see [Settings](#settings) for further information). Here one can set all the metadata for running the program and set what PRONOM files should be converted to. A formats ```Default``` PRONOM is a list of all the PRONOM's belonging to that file format (i.e all PRONOM's associated with the PDF file format).

## Settings
Settings can be manually set in an ```xml``` file.

### Setting run time arguments
```xml  
    <Requester></Requester>                    <!-- Name of person requesting the conversion -->
    <Converter></Converter>                    <!-- Name of person doing the conversion -->
	<ChecksumHashing></ChecksumHashing>    <!-- SHA256 (standard) or MD5 -->
	<InputFolder></InputFolder>            <!-- Specify input folder, default is "input" -->
	<OutputFolder></OutputFolder>          <!-- Specify output folder, default is "output" -->
	<MaxThreads></MaxThreads>	       <!-- Write a number, deafult is cores*2 -->
	<Timeout></Timeout>       	       <!-- Timeout in minutes, default is 30min -->
	<MaxFileSize></MaxFileSize>	       <!-- Max total input bytes per file for merged files, default is 1GB. Note: output file size may differ from total of input files -->
```

The first part of the XML file concerns arguments needed to run the program. The second part allows you to set up two things:
1. Global settings stating that file format ```x``` should be converted to file format ```y```.
2. Folder settings stating that file format ```x``` should be converted to file format ```y``` in the specific folder ```folder```.

### Global settings
```xml
<FileClass>
    <ClassName>pdf</ClassName>
    <Default>fmt/477</Default>  <!-- The target PRONOM code the class should be converted to -->
    <FileTypes>
           <Filename>pdf</Filename>
       <Pronoms>       <!-- List of all PRONOMs that should be converted to the target PRONOM -->
              fmt/95,fmt/354,fmt/476,fmt/477 ,fmt/478 ,fmt/479 ,fmt/480
       </Pronoms>
    <Default></Default>
    </FileTypes>
</FileClass>
```

### Folder settings
```xml
<FolderOverride>
	<FolderPath>apekatter</FolderPath>      <!-- Path after input folder example: /documents -->
	<Pronoms>fmt/41, fmt/42, fmt/43, fmt/44, x-fmt/398</Pronoms>
	<ConvertTo>fmt/14</ConvertTo>
	<MergeImages></MergeImages>             <!-- Yes, No -->
</FolderOverride>
```

For a more extensive **PRONOM-based** overview you can ***click*** on the following image to be taken to a codesandbox code snippet: <br>
[![Edit file-converter](https://github.com/larsmhaugland/file-converter/assets/117298604/e0b35b20-43e2-4081-908f-19cb885951e4)](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/file-converter-ynh84y)

The code snippet is based on data from the following JSON file: **[Supported Conversions.](DevDocumentation/supportedconversions.json)** <br>
For a more extensive overview for **each external converter** see the following TXT file: **[Supported Conversions per converter.](DevDocumentation/supportedconversions.txt)**

## Documentation and logging 
The ```.txt```log files use the following convention and is automatically generated each time the program is run:
```
Type | (Error) Message | Format | Filetype | Filename
```
All log files can be found in the ```logs``` folder.

Additionally, a ```documentation.json``` file is created which lists all files and their respective data.
```json
{"Metadata": {
    "requester": "Name",
    "converter": "Name"
     "hashing": "SHA256"
  },
  "Files": [
    {
      "Filename": "output\\filename.pdf",
      "OriginalPronom": "fmt/14",
      "OriginalChecksum": "6c6458545d3a41967a5ef2f12b1b03ad6a6409641670f823635cfb766181f636",
      "OriginalSize": 513631,
      "TargetPronom": "fmt/477",
      "NewPronom": "fmt/477",
      "NewChecksum": "b462a8261d26ece8707fac7f6921cc0ddfb352165cb608a38fed92ed044a6a05",
      "NewSize": 519283,
      "Converter": [
	"iText7 8.0.3.0"
	],
      "IsConverted": true
    }]}
```

## Adding a new converter or conversion path
Adding new external converters or conversion paths is described in detail in the **[Adding a new converter](https://github.com/larsmhaugland/file-converter/blob/main/addingconverter.md) guide.**

# Use cases
Here are the use cases, please reflect and write something down for each use case about how understandable the README/source code was and how manageable it was to do the task.

Use case tasks:
+ Add a new conversion path route that converts a document from Word to PDF to PDF-A.
+ Change the settings, using the ```settings.xml``` so that Word documents get converted to PDF-A.
+ Change the settings, using the GUI, so that Word documents get converted to PDF-A.
+ Run the program in CLI with the proper options to specify the input and output directory.
+ Try to combine a set of images into one PDF.

Questions regarding use cases:
+ Were there any tasks you weren't able to complete? Was it because of a lack of understanding or due to a bug in the program?
+ Were there any tasks that you feel could be simplified?

Questions regarding README:
+ Was it clear how to download, install and build the program?
+ Did you encounter any instructions in the README that weren't correct?
+ Were there any sections you found vague/unhelpful?
+ Are there some sections you would have liked that weren't here?
